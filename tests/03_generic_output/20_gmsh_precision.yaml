# Test goal: Testing the output precision in GMSH format.
# Author: Pavel Exner
# Source for reference: Compare mesh data with the mesh on input.
# The reference data (node coordinates) were taken from the original mesh.
# Precision is set to 10 digits, also ndiff tolerance is set to 1e-10 in config.yaml.
# Only conductivity (given constant) is written, so it is accurate and no linear solver error is involved
# in the output file.
