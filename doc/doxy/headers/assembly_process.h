 *
 * \section classes Overview of assembly process
 *
 * Evaluation of Fields is performed during assemblies at different evaluation points. Assembly process allows summary 
 * evaluation of elements on one patch. The calculation is performed subsequently on all these elements.
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Solved problems</h2>
 *    
 * FieldFE use FEValues in implementation of the `value` method, this involves creation of the FEValues object. This object 
 * should be created only once ideally.
 * 
 * FieldFormula can be evaluated efficiently for the vectors of points. So we need to evaluate lot of points together. That 
 * is possible once the points are from elements of the same region.
 * 
 * We need to achieve effective use of memory:
 *   - efficient ordering of the mesh nodes and elements
 *   - same evaluations of different field types during the assembly process
 *   - use one memory place involved during assembly on the single element
 * Enable advantage of the vector operations.          
 *
 * 
 * <h2>Design ideas and constraints</h2>
 *
 * The weak formulation is based on the evaluation of the integrals of four types:
 *   - <b>bulk integral</b> - decomposed to simplix elements
 *   - <b>edge integral</b> - decomposed to edges, edge is set of colocated faces/sides
 *   - <b>boundary integral</b> - decomposed to: boundary element of dimension D + faces of bulk elements of dimension D+1 
 *   - <b>coupling integral</b> - decomposed to: bulk element of dimension D + faces of elements of dimension D+1 
 * The integration over elementary domain is done in terms of numerical quadrature, i.e. weighted average of the values 
 * in quadrature points. Single logical quadrature point may be distributed to more then one bulk element. 
 *
 * All necessary quadrature points must be distributed to the reference elements during setup of the assmebly. FieldFE is 
 * then able to create and precompute the FEValue object for all these local points. The values on the reference element 
 * are computed once. Mapping (of vectors and tensors) to the actual element can be done only for the active points on current 
 * patch of elements.
 *
 * For the efficient evaluation of the FieldFormula fields we need to evaluate about 128 points at once. Efficient parsing 
 * and formula evaluation library is necessary. We use a specially developed parser for this purpose: *BParser*.
 * 
 * In order to allow FieldFormula to depend on other fields we need that other fields are also evaluated into caches. This is 
 * a bit unfortunate for the FieldConstant and possibly cache inefficient in the case of FieldFE. The FieldFE caching is 
 * inefficient only in the case of using same FE space for some field as well as for the equation itself, that is in the case 
 * of nonlinear equations. Even in such case, we at most compute local base functions twice, once when prefetching the field 
 * value cache and second when assembling on individual elements. If the recalculation takes longer then L3 access we can cache 
 * all FEValue data for all patch quad points.
 * 
 * Example of CPU specification: Intel Core i7: L1d 32kB, L2 256kB, L3 8MB. 
 * [I7 cache specification](https://www.edn.com/design/systems-design/4399725/Memory-Hierarchy-Design---Part-6--The-Intel-Core-i7): 
 * block size 64 bytes, L1d 8way, L2 8way, L3 16way shared for cores  (What if every core works on separate memory chunk,
 * 16 way can be limitting factor?)
 * Considering about 30 scalar fields, 128 points per field and 8 bytes per double the field cache is about 30kB, 
 * that fits (with other data as Dofs, FEValues) well within L2 cache, even if we consider using just half of 
 * it to allow prefetching. Conclusion: size of the field cache that enables amortization of formula evaluation 
 * is about the size suitable for the CPU cache optimization of the assembly process.     
 * 
 * We need to join evaluation of FieldFormula for individual integrals so there will be more complex logic in the selection of field 
 * algorithm since only subset of the fields is involved in every integral.
 * 
 * Gauss quadratures imply no shared quadrature points between bulk and face quadratures. There can be some reuse for boundary and 
 * coupling integrals, but these are relatively rare.
 * 
 * Face integrals should deal with various side permutations.
 * 
 * We should use existing field variables to referencing their cached values.
 * 
 * Although we will have a common set of local evaluation points on the reference element we may allow to use only subset of them on 
 * the actual patch of elements.
 * 
 * The mapping of the pair (element, evaluation point) to the active point on the current patch must be same for all fields invloved 
 * in the assembly. We need a class for this synchronisation.
 * 
 * Ideas to exploit SIMD:
 *   - Once the fields are precomputed the assmbly of local matrix/vector can use SIMD operations as the forms are evaluated uing a same  
 *     formula for every (i-shape, j-shape, q-point). 
 *   - We can possibly even assembly more elements at once. Considering the local matrices/vectors be placed in a continuous block of memory.
 *   - Possible problem is that as we iterate over the shape functions the field values remains constant so we may need to load the field values 
 *     into constant small vectors. 
 *   - FieldFormula - in order to use SIMD we need to organize the patch q-points into the SIMD blocks (4-AVX2, 8-AVX512, seems relevant also 
 *     on GPUs). First atempt will just put elements of the same region into a continuous block, further we may modify patches to optimize number 
 *     of the regions per patch.
 *   - FieldValues - the vectors and tensors has to be transformed be a mapping matrix. One matrix-vector multiplication takes 9 products and 6 
 *     additions these operations should be vectorized over several vectors. Transformation matrices are usually constant on the element so we 
 *     need to repeat them. 
 *   - FieldFE - see FieldValues, further value in a point is linear combination of the same number of the shape functions (for the same dimension 
 *     and order) Vectorisation over points of the elements of the same dimension and order is possible.               
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Caching structures</h2>
 *
 * <b>EvalPoints</b> 
 * Summary all quadrature points on the reference elements. Necessary for the fields precalculation.
 *   - Internaly single table per dimension, but we need to distribute quadrature points accross dimension so there has to be one shared object. 
 *     However quadratures are added per dimension in the Assembly classes.
 *   - Every reference element (dimension) have own list of local points. Only resulting 'Integral' objects know ranges of their points.
 *   
 * <b>Integrals</b> 
 * We have four types of "elementatry integration domains":
 *   - BulkIntegral - on Cell
 *   - EdgeIntegral - on edge.side_range
 *   - CouplingIntegral - on bulk.ngh_range
 *   - BoundaryIntegral - on boundary_side_range (TBD)
 *   - In theory we can combine integrals to have at most single instance of each type per single assembly operation.
 *   - For every dimension we create them by a method of the EvalPoints, passing suitable set of quadratures.
 *   - Functions provided by Integrals:
 *      - Mark active eval points on the actual patch. Assembly algorithm iterates over "elementary integration domains" in the order of their Hilbert 
 *        index. The integral has to iterate over its quadrature points. The point and distributing the points on them until we reach the number of 
 *        active points per patch.
 *      - Iteration over qudrature points for given actual "elementaty integration domain" (e.g. edge integral for the CellSide)
 *   - Same method Integral::points(assembly_object) is used later on to iterate over quadrature points.
 *   - In principle there is one kind of the quadrature point accessor for every kind of the integral.
 *     
 * Operations provided by the quadrature points:
 *   - 'field(point)' - retrieve value of a field in the point, e.g. 'pressure(bulk_point)' 
 *   - 'side_point.point_on(cell_side)' - returns 'SidePoint' on the other side; allows iteration over all pairs of sides of an edge, in fact allows 
 *     to form integrals mixing points of any two faces of same dimension, even non-colocated
 *   - 'coupling_side_point.lower_dim()' - returns 'BulkPoint' collocated with the side point in the dimension coupling. 
 * 
 * Possible interface to shape functions: 
 *   - 'ElementFields element_fields ...' - values independent of the FEM, depends on mesh and mapping 
 *   - 'FieldFE pressure_fe ...'
 *   - 'element_fields.normal(side_point)' - outer normal at a side point 
 *   - 'element_fields.coord(point)' - absolute coordinates of the point 
 *   - 'element_fields.JxW(point)' - Jacobian times quadrature weight of the point 'pressure_fe.base(i, point)' - value of the i-th shape function in 
 *     the point 
 *   - 'pressure_fe.grad(i, point)' - value of the i-th base function in the point. 
 * 
 * <b>ElementCacheMap</b> 
 * This holds mesh elements (sorted by regions) associated with the actual patch and for every pair (mesh element, eval_point) gives the active point 
 * index, these have to form continuous sequence. The points of the "assemble objects" forming the patch are added to the map. There should be no active 
 * points reuse as the active points of the two "assemble objects" of the same kind are disjoint (can change if we decide to change elemetary "assembly 
 * objects", e.g. single NGHSide instead of the range). ElementCacheMap is shared by dimensions !! It should be part of the EqData.
 * 
 * <b>FieldValueCache</b>
 *   - One per field, holds only raw data for selected integrals.
 *   - It needs to use access to other classes for evaluation ('ElementCacheMap', 'Field' operators). 
 *   - One value is a scalar, vector, or tensor. But stored through Array in a single chunk of memory. We probably use a single chunk of memory for 
 *     all fields.  
 *     
 *
 * 
 * <h2>Assemblation classes</h2>   
 *      
 * <b>AssemblyBase &lt;dim&gt; </b>
 * Common virtual ancestor of all assembly classes. Defines their common methods and data members. One instance for every dimension.
 *
 * <b>XYZAssembly &lt;dim&gt; </b>
 *   - descendants of AssemblyBase implementing internals of a single assemblation process
 *   - methods:
 *      - XYZAssembly(eq_fields, eq_data) - constructor, sets shared data with equation
 *      - initialize(element_cache_map) - reinit called typicaly once per simulation, creates FEValues object, resisez vectors etc.
 *      - begin - called at beginning of the general assembly (e.g. start balance or matrix assembly)
 *      - end - called after general asssembly
 *      - cell_integral(cell, element_patch_idx) - assembles the volume integrals on cell
 *      - boundary_side_integral(cell_side) - assembles between boundary element and side of bulk element
 *      - edge_integral(edge_side_range) - assembles between sides on the edge
 *      - dimjoin_intergral(cell_lower_dim, neighb_side) - assembles between elements of different dimensions      
 *
 * <b>GenericAssembly &lt;...&gt; </b>
 *   - templated by a class derived from AssemblyBase
 *   - contains the assembly machinary, wrap it to a single method 'assembly', this method:
 *      1. Call 'reallocate' of ElementCacheMap and 'begin' of templated assembly class.
 *      2. Iterates over cells (elements) and fills patch.
 *      3. Call assembly methods (cell_integral etc.) of templated assembly class if patch is full.
 *      4. Repeat points 2. and 3. until all cells have passed.
 *      5. Call 'end' of templated assembly class.    
 *  
 *
 *  
 * <h2>Cache operations</h2>  
 * 
 * <b>Overview</b>
 * Usage of the field caches consists of:
 *   1. Merging more quadratures into a single set of the local evaluation points (class `EvalPoints`).
 *   2. Create a `FieldSet` one for every quadrature of the fields involved in that integral. 
 *   3. Initialize the fields in the integral's field set: Allocate the cache space in fields and mark which quadrature the field use. This is done 
 *      through the call of `FieldSet::cache_reallocate(ElementCacheMap cache_map, FieldSet used_fields)`
 *   4. Composing the assambly patch, element cache prefetching. This is organized by 
 *      `ElementCacheMap`.
 *   5. Assembly: Iterate over Integrals and get cached values from the fields.
 *   
 * <h3>1. Initialization - evaluation points</h3>
 * 
 * <b>EvalPoints</b>
 * The class to store set of common local points. Two operations:
 *   1. Add a point set, return their indices in the table. Contrary, we want to keep the points from the single quadrature in a single continuous 
 *      block. In fact, we probably need to use two distinguised methods: 
 *        - 'BulkIntegral &&EvalPoints::add_bulk(Quadrature bulk_quadrature)' 
 *        - 'BoundaryIntegral &&add_boundary(Quadrature side_quadrature)' 
 *        - 'EdgeIntegral &&add_edge(Quadrature side_quadrature)'
 *        - 'CouplingIntegral &&add_coupling(Quadrature bulk_quadrature)'   
 *   2. Get local point coordinates for given index.
 * 
 * Common storage of quadrature points is not necessary anymore, but we keep it in order to keep indexing of the points the same accross the fields 
 * (which can use ony certain subblocks of the points). We can decrease the memory footprint (and thus the cache footprint) at the expense of slower 
 * access to the cached values (one more indirect memory access).      
 * 
 * <b>EvalSubset</b>
 * The object containing array of indices into local point set, there is only single array for the bulk quadrature, but (n_sides x n_permutations) 
 * for a side quadrature. We shall try to keep this common for the bulk and side quadratures and non-templated. It keeps pointer to the EvalPoints, 
 * in particular to know total number of local points.
 * 
 * <b>Example</b>

    Assembly(EqFields *eq_fields, EqData *eq_data)

        // set list of used EvalSubsets, these are created automatically in GenericAssembly constructor
        this->active_integrals_ = ActiveIntegrals::bulk | ActiveIntegrals::boundary;
    }

    void initialize(ElementCacheMap *element_cache_map) {
        this->element_cache_map_ = element_cache_map;  // set data member of AssemblyBase

        // initialize data members
        fe_ = std::make_shared< FE_P_disc<dim> >(eq_data_->order);

 * <h3>2. Integration field set</h3>  
 *
 * This use existing field subset to simplify group operations on those.
 *   
 * @dot
    Assembly(EqFields *eq_fields, EqData *eq_data)
    : AssemblyBase<dim>(eq_data_->order), eq_fields_(eq_fields), eq_data_(eq_data) {
        this->active_integrals_ = ActiveIntegrals::bulk | ActiveIntegrals::boundary;
        
        // add list of used fields to subset
        this->used_fields_ += eq_fields_->mass_matrix_coef;
        this->used_fields_ += eq_fields_->retardation_coef;
    }
 * @enddot  
 * 
 * <h3>3. Initialization - cache allocation</h3> 
 * 
 * 'FieldSet::cache_reallocate' just adds dependent fields (eg. coordinates in FieldFormula, used fields in FieldModel) and calls the same method 
 * for every 'FieldCommon' in the set.
 * 
 * This is a virtual method with implementation in 'Field<...>'.
 * 
 * <i>TODO: Different assembly loops may need different evaluation subsets, so either we need mean to reallocate caches before every assembly loop 
 * or just update only selected part of the field value cache. Current structure of FieldValueCache allows to have allocated individual EvalSubset 
 * tables separately and update only selected subsets. Moreover the other subsets do not block the CPU cache (example of associativity, seems that 
 * AMD processors have 4way L1, 16way L2 and 64way L3 cache; try to get similar info for Intel) anyway we shuld mak an analysis how many memory 
 * blocks we need in any computation loop. Innermost loops should idealy access at most 4 memory blocks (4 pointers).</i>  
 * 
 * <h3>4. ElementCacheMap</h3>   
 * 
 * The map is represented by the table with dimensions [n_cache_elements][n_eval_points]. n_cache_elements is choosen as fixed (relative to number 
 * of QP in dimensions, some heuristic formula necessary), n_eval_points given before assembly. Following algorithm must avoid allocations.
 * 
 * Filling algorithm:
 *   1. step - Iterate over integrals collect them into a fronts (per integral type, four types). - Count total number of QP. - Stop when cache 
 *      capacity is reached. - Put touched elements into an array patch_elements, pairs (region_idx, element_idx) - Drop last uncomplete integral group
 *   2. step - sort patch_elements by region - set whole cache map table to -1 - loop over integrals (in fronts) mark needed QP by 1 - loop over whole 
 *      cache map number active QPs
 *   3. step - loop over fields in the field set - for every field make groups of regions for distiguish field algorithms - for every field algorithm 
 *      call cache update on QP subset (indices of beginings of SIMD groups)
 *   4. step - loop over integrals - call assembly routines        
 *   
 * Notes:
 *   - Every integral struct implements methods for steps: 1. and 2.
 *   - For step 1. and 2. the method modifies the element cache map object passed as an argument. Use specific modification methods in ElementCacheMap.
 *   - Step 3. independent of integrals.
 *   - For step 4. we pass the integral object to the assembly routine.
 *   - BulkIntegral: DHCellAccessor + subset index
 *   - EdgeIntegral: keeps range returned by cell_side.edge_sides() + subset index
 *   - DimJoinIntegral: DHCellAccessor, DHCellSideAccessor + bulk_subset, side_subset
 *   - BoundaryIntegral: DHCellSideAccessor + side_subset
 *   - When fields are changed make a topological sort of dependent fields on every region.
 *   - <i>Question: optimisation of FieldFormula evaluation over more regions is a bit complex. Need further analysis of relationships.</i>  
 *   
 * <i>DEPRECATED: This class synchronize the cached elements between (all) fields of single equation. It provides mapping from elements to the cache 
 * index and list of elements to cache. This have overloaded evaluation operator, which returns the index in the cache for the given element (or element 
 * index). The last cache line is overwritten if the index is not in the cache. The implementation use: table cache_idx -> el_idx, hash mapping 
 * el_idx -> cache_idx, list of cache lines that schould be updated.</i>

    // Possible update of the base function values.
    presssure_field_fe.fe_values.update(cell);
 * @enddot  
 * 
 * Two major algorithms are in use:
 *   - FieldFE - evaluates base func values in all quadrature points (done once per assembly), dot product with DOFs, optionaly multiplied by the Mapping 
 *     matrix (important optimization for vector fields and derivatives, must have support in FEValues)
 *      - FieldFE has three instances of FEValues, one for every dimension. This is possible as the EvalPoints are structured by the dimension.
 *      - During cache update we:
 *         a. for every element in the elementcache map (range of elements in the region)
 *         b. find element dimension, call fe_values[dim].reinit(el) for that element
 *         c. update cache values in that row of the element cache map 
 *      - The reinit may be slightly inefficient as all values are computed not only the active. We can try to optimize that after it is in use and we can 
 *        see if it is a real problem.      
 *   - FieldFormula - evaluates all elements in the patch (same region), in all point from single continuous block od quad points

 * 
 * In order to use FieldValueCache in consistent way, we can precompute: quadrature points coordinates, normals and JxW into suitable 
 * FieldValueCache and possibly wrap it into Fields in order to use them in FieldFormula. However direct access should be provided through 
 * BulkPoint and SidePoint. precise We want cache_allocate and cache_update to update the mapping caches however we have to pass the mapping 
 * somehow into XYPoint and to do this on single place we want to pass it to EvalPoints.
 *   
 * <b>Interface for the bulk integrals</b>
 * 
 * Bulk integrals are evaluated only on the single element, so we can assume, that all values are cached. No need for evaluationg just some points 
 * etc. 'Field<..>::operator() (BulkPoint)' use dimension and cache element index that are part of the BulkPoint structure to access the cached 
 * value. Similarly we can exted caching in FeValues to more elements and provide acces to them: 
 *   - 'FieldFE<..>::base_value(BulkPoint, component)'
 *   - 'FieldFE<..>::base_grad(BulkPoint, component)'
 *   
 * <b>Interface for the edge integrals</b>
 *    
 * We need to access values on two elements of two matching sides. All sides of all elements are necessary so we want to cache all side points in 
 * the same way as the values in bulk points. We can access matching side but we also need its proper permutation, to this end we provide SidePoint 
 * and its mapping to the connected side of the other element.
 *   - `Field<..>::operator() (SidePoint)`
 *   - `FieldFE<..>::base_value(SidePoint, component)`
 *   - `FieldFE<..>::base_grad(SidePoint, component)` 
 *
 * <b>Interface for dimension coupling integrals</b>
 * 
 * In general the quadrature can be different then the quadrature used on faces, or the could be no integration over the faces as in the case of P1 
 * method. No problem for the lower dim element as we have to evaluate fields at all bulk points on al these elements. Only matching evaluation points 
 * on the connected side of a bulk element are necessary. Moreover we are not able to change mask of evaluation point accoring to the elements.
 * 
 * Two possible solutions:
 *   - local point sets varies with elements
 *   - evaluation of noncached values, but still want to have the FieldValues in FieldFE for their points
 *   
 * <i>TODO:
 *   - No sense to have more then single bulk element in bulk integrals.
 *   - In Side integrals need: normals, more then single element (elements of same or different dimension).
 *   - How to match q poiunts on side of higher dim element and bulk of lower dim elemnet. Not clear how it works in current implementation. Is the 
 *     side permutation compatible with connected fracture elements?
 *   - How to cache values in quadrature points on faces of the higher dim elements efficiently? We want to precompute only values on a single side. 
 *     It could be fine in case of DG if we use same quadratures for side terms as well as for the coupling temrs. But for general quadratures there 
 *     could be problem. It seems the either we do not cache in this case or need more general cache.
 *   - How to apply only FeValues to FE living on edges without FeSideValues.</i>          
 * 
 * <b>Further thoughts:</b>
 *   - Extension to interdependent fields: If a field depends on the other field, it recursively informs the other field about quadrature.
 *   - We introduce fields for absolute cooridinates X, Y, Z as well as for the depth, this is related to the generalization of the FieldFormula, that 
 *     can use also other fields in the formulas.
