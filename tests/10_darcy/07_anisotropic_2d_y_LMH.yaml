# Test goal: Test anisotropic fields, conductivity in Darcy flow in particular.
# Author: Pavel Exner
# Source for reference: qualitative
#   The results are compared with the solution using isotropic K=[1,1,1].
#   When setting K=[1,0.1,1], the flux over boundaries .bc_east and .bc_west
#   are exactly 0.1 of the fluxes in the isotropic case.
